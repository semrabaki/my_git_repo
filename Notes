GIT- is version control tool
You can store, access, use, track and share all new or older codes
Collaboration and Team Work
We can save different versions
We can update the existing code and save it

Version means commit 

GITHUB
Online version of Git it is safe the use github when you have big project

Oopen your eclipse
2. Create a Java project
3. -name my_git_repo
4.create a new package
5.create a new Class
5. Open terminal
- Right click on your project
-Show In then If you see Terminal select it
8.We have to be on the project folder: my_git_repo
Now we can start using git for this project
---------------
type git init in the terminal

Pushing Code To Git:
1.-git init  (it creates .git folder)
-git init must be used only once, when we a create a new project.

2.git status ( it is used for to learn whatever in that project) This is used to check the status of the files
This is our friends 
We can use git status to learn the files that is not committed
Red meann UNCOMMITTED FILES

3.git add .   (This is used for move the code in the staging area

.git status
Green means codes are ready to be COMMITTED
We can create  a new version

4.git commit -m "first Commit" ("" icine hangi mesaji yazidirrsan yazdir)
We now created a new VERSION

git status
------------------------------------------------------

******************Hot to send the code to GITHUB????
1.Open your GITHUB account
2.Create a new repository
3.Go to REositories
4. Click on New
5.Repository Name: my_fit_repo
6.Click Create Reppsitory
Then we should see INSTRUCTION to push your first code
7.
git branch -M main
git remote add origin https://github.com/semrabaki/my_git_repo.git
git push -u origin main

Note: If there is no error, then your code should be 

NOTE: If there is no error, then your codes should now be in github
NOTE: IF YOU SEE ERROR THEN YOU CAN CHECK YOUR CONFIGURATION:
In the same terminal :
***. git config --global user.name "your github username"
***. git config --global user.email "your github email"
***. git config --list
***. git config credential.username "your github username"
***. git config credential.password "your github password"
AND TRY PUSHING ONE MORE TIME:
git push -u origin main

========================2nd Code Push=================================
As of now, I oushed all my local code to gitHub repository
NOW WHAT SHOULD I DO, IF I ADD NEW CODES IN MY LOCAL?
1. Creat SEconsJavaClass
make sure save the code
1.git add .
 git status check
 2. git commit -m "second commit"
 3. git push
 
 
 Day 2
 ==========================
 only push specific file
 
 type git status 
 them pick the one which are red
 copy
 then git add "src/my_git_repo/ThirdJavaClass.java"
 then push and check github for update
 
 Task2= there are 10 files and you want to send 9 of them what to do
 =====================================
 We create .gitignore file in the project level
 
 and the file that I do not want to send and save in git ignore save it and refresh
 
 ====================GIT STAGES==============================================
 
 git add .  sends our code to staging area which is still in our computer like a temproray memory
git commit -m  sends my code to local repositpry from staging are 

git push- sends my code to github

===================How we pull the code to my eclipse ============================================
git pull==> brings and adds to your local repo

git fetch=>brings code from github to your local repisotry


git merge=> brings code from your local repisorty to ecplipse (IDD)


Task====
Go you your GitHub repo and create a new file in the project level : MyNotes.txt
Add File > Create new file > name: MyNotes1.txt > commit new file
Then go to your terminal and pull the code in your local repo
git pull
Then we you see the GitHub and local codes are now the same

========================================
Senaryo: for example you created a file on github and eclipse 

you need to pull the file from github before you push otherwise you will get error message. 
int this case you should pull first
